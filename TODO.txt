CLIENT
* Improve graphs
    * Axis bounds
    * Box plots
* Add UI to compare tournaments + players
    * Allow multiple rounds to be compared on the graph
        * This is now working but there are some issues:
             * 2,3 and 4 drop downs only populate after a selection in one of the others
             * If tournament 1 has less rounds than tournament 2 then not all tournament 2's rounds will be shown
    * Move to use a '+' button rather than a dropdown
* Show more raw stats rather than just graphs
    * New area below the graph?

SERVER
* Implement APIs for sending shot time data
    * Consider which APIs would be useful
        * Get ast by player

SCRAPER
* Implement way to stitch Qualifier tournaments into their main components...
    * This wouldn't work for World Champs, but should for minor Ts
* Implement emails in preparation for automated running
* Implement automated running as a CRON job of rasp pi (need cloud DB first)

DB
* Migrate to cloud solution
